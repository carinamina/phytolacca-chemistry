The LCMS datasets are generated from the Progenesis software that processes raw data from liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry samples. The samples were run July 27 2018. This was a re-run of the exact same samples run in December 2017 and February 2018, which were analyzed for CB's dissertation but showed a batch effect that was confounded with latitude. Unlike the Dec/Feb samples, we did a bit more processing in Progenesis before the excel sheet was exported:
--Used a pooled sample from multiple "induced" plants (position 162) as a reference alignment for normalization
--excluded peaks >7.5 retention time (thought to be just cell membrane lipids)
--excluded blanks and fruits from peak picking process
--Normalized to Telmisartan (4.75_514.2383n) in Progenesis, so all samples have the same abundance of this compound

These datasets are organized transposed to how datasets are usually organized; the first column is the compound and all the other columns are the samples.

Compared to Raw, I deleted certain columns in Excel: all Raw Abundance (columns LS and onward); one fruit sample; pooled samples; informational columns at the beginning (e.g. Neutral mass, m/z, Charge, Retention time). I also removed the two extra header rows.

Compound		individual compounds; information on mass and mass-to-charge ratio is included in name but cryptic to me

XS2_072718_003	XS2=?	(same for all)
		072718 = date samples were run (same for all)
		003 = matches the LCMS_order column (NOT sample_order) in the LCMS_SampleKey file
		Each row is the abundance of the compound in column 1.

Remaining columns are samples; names only differ in the LCMS_order number

Note that the last two columns are "blanks" with only the solvent (see the LCMS_SampleKey file)
